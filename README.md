1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project involved designing a comprehensive online system for the client, DriverPass, which offers driving courses and resources to help individuals pass their driving tests. The client wanted a system that could manage course registrations, track student progress, schedule driving tests, and provide practice resources. The system needed to be user-friendly, scalable, and capable of handling multiple users simultaneously, ensuring a smooth experience for both students and instructors.

2. What did you do particularly well?

One aspect I did particularly well was the thorough gathering and documentation of business requirements. By clearly understanding the client's needs and translating them into specific, actionable requirements, I ensured that the design would meet their expectations. Additionally, I was meticulous in creating detailed UML diagrams, which provided a clear visualization of system processes and interactions. These diagrams were instrumental in guiding the development process and ensuring that all components of the system were well-integrated.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the user interface design section of the system design document. I think I should have expanded on the entire process to ensure to include the package verification. I think there should a sepearate check to ensure only members who have paid for certain packages have access to those packages. Because there currently is not a check in my System Design Document or UML Activity to show this process. I think it needs to apart of these documents and it is something I would go back and revise.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Interpreting the user’s needs involved conducting thorough research, including interviews with stakeholders and analyzing potential user scenarios. I translated these needs into specific system requirements, ensuring that the design addressed key user pain points and delivered a seamless experience. It’s crucial to consider the user’s needs in the design process because the success of any system depends on its usability and how well it meets the users' expectations. A system that doesn’t align with user needs is likely to face issues with adoption and satisfaction, ultimately impacting its effectiveness.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach to designing software starts with a deep understanding of the problem space, followed by gathering and documenting requirements. I prioritize user-centered design, ensuring that the system is built around the needs and behaviors of its users. I employ techniques like creating personas, developing user stories, and drawing UML diagrams to map out system interactions. In the future, I would continue to use these strategies while also incorporating more iterative design processes, such as prototyping and user testing, to refine the design based on feedback. This approach ensures that the final product is both functional and user-friendly.
